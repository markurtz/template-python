"""
Compatibility abstractions for optional dependencies.

This module centralizes fallback logic for safely importing optional dependencies
like ``psutil``, ``opentelemetry``, and TOML parsers. It provides standardized
access points for these modules, avoiding scattered ``try-except`` blocks across
the codebase. Maintainers should import optional dependencies from this module
rather than attempting direct imports elsewhere.
