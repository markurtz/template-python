# project_name Examples

This directory contains practical, runnable demonstrations of how to use `project_name` in various scenarios. These examples are designed to help you quickly understand core concepts, advanced configurations, and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, ensure you have set up your environment correctly:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have installed the core package for your environment and any example-specific requirements.
1. **Environment Variables:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if the examples require configuration (e.g., API keys or external services).

> [!NOTE]
> Some examples may require additional dependencies not included in the core `project_name` package. Please check the `README.md` within each specific example directory for details.

## Running the Examples

Most examples can be executed directly from the command line. Navigate to the root of the repository and run the desired script:

```bash
# Example: Running a generic example script
python examples/example_template/main.py
```

> [!TIP]
> **Always run examples from the repository root.** This ensures that all relative paths, environment variables, and module imports resolve correctly.
