If you discover a security vulnerability, please bring it to our attention right away using one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred):** Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the **[Security tab](https://github.com/{{organization}}/{{project_name}}/security/advisories)** of this repository.
2. **Email:** Send your report directly to **[INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS OR SECURITY CONTACT]**. *(Optional: Encrypt your email using our PGP key: [INSERT PGP KEY LINK/FINGERPRINT])*

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Detailed description** of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)** code or screenshots, if available.
- **Environment details** (e.g., version of `{{project_name}}`, OS, relevant configurations).

## Triage and Resolution Process

We will handle your report with strict confidentiality. Our process is as follows:

1. **Acknowledgment:** We will respond to your report as soon as possible, usually within **[INSERT NUMBER, e.g., 48] hours**.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Vulnerabilities within the core `{{project_name}}` codebase.
- Security issues in our default configurations.

**Out of Scope:**
- Volumetric Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Theoretical issues without a reproducible PoC.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are not exploitable through `{{project_name}}`.
- Missing security headers or best practices that do not lead to a direct exploit.

*(Note: We currently **[do/do not]** operate a bug bounty program. Disclosures are greatly appreciated but are not eligible for financial rewards at this time.)*
