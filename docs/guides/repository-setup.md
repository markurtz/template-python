# Setting up the repository

Welcome to your new repository! If you have just instantiated this project from the template, there are a few configuration steps required to get your standalone project fully operational.

This guide acts as a checklist for the project maintainer. Once these steps are complete, your CI/CD pipelines, documentation site, and release workflows will be fully enabled.

## 1. Bootstrap the repository

Before making any manual changes, run the included bootstrap script to automatically replace all placeholder variables (like `project_name` and `{{organization}}`) with your actual project details.

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh \
  --project-name my-cool-project \
  --project-desc "A description of my cool project" \
  --organization my-org \
  --org-name "My Organization"
```

> [!NOTE]
> This script will rename the source directory (`src/project_name/` -> `src/my_cool_project/`) and update all references in the documentation, GitHub Actions workflows, and configuration files.

Once you have verified the changes, you can safely delete the `scripts/bootstrap.sh` file and commit the updates.

## 2. Configure GitHub settings

To ensure code quality and security, configure the following settings in your repository:

1. **Enable Discussions (Optional but recommended):**
   Go to **Settings > General > Features** and check **Discussions**.

1. **Branch Protection Rules:**
   Go to **Settings > Branches** and add a protection rule for `main`.

   - Check **Require a pull request before merging**.
   - Check **Require status checks to pass before merging** (Require the `main` or `build` job from your CI workflow).
   - Check **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**.

1. **Tag Protection Rules:**
   Go to **Settings > Tags** and add a protection rule for `v*` tags to ensure only authorized maintainers can push release tags.

## 3. Enable documentation hosting

This template uses MkDocs Material to generate a beautiful documentation site. The site is automatically built and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch by the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow when changes are merged into `main`.

To enable hosting:

1. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
1. Under **Build and deployment**, set the **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
1. Set the **Branch** to `gh-pages` and the folder to `/ (root)`.
1. Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> The `gh-pages` branch will be created automatically the first time the `pages.yml` workflow runs successfully. If it doesn't exist yet, push a change to `main` to trigger the build, then return to the Pages settings to configure it.

## 4. Configure PyPI trusted publishing

The template includes a `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow that automatically publishes your package to PyPI when a release is created. This workflow uses **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**, which is more secure than using API tokens.

To configure Trusted Publishing:

1. Go to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and navigate to your account settings.
1. Under **Publishing**, add a new **Pending Publisher**.
1. Set the **GitHub repository owner** to your organization or username.
1. Set the **GitHub repository name** to your project name.
1. Set the **Workflow name** to `release.yml`.
1. Set the **Environment name** to `pypi` (or leave it blank if not using an environment in your workflow, though the template defaults to a `pypi` environment).

Once the first release is published, the publisher will become active.

## 5. Enable container builds

If your project includes a `Dockerfile` and you want to publish container images to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), the template workflows are already prepared.

1. Ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `write` permissions for packages. Go to **Settings > Actions > General**.
1. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure it is set to **Read and write permissions**.
1. When the `release.yml` or `nightly.yml` workflows run, they will build and push the container image to `ghcr.io/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_PROJECT`.

You may also want to make the package public once it is published by going to your Organization's **Packages** settings.

## 6. Manage versions and releases

This template is designed to use Git tags for versioning (e.g., via `hatch-vcs` or a similar dynamic versioning tool). You do not need to hardcode the version number in `pyproject.toml` or `__init__.py`.

To cut a new release:

1. **Tag the commit:** Create an annotated tag for your release (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
1. **Create a GitHub Release:** Go to the repository's **Releases** page and draft a new release using the tag you just pushed.
1. **Automated Publishing:** Creating the release will trigger the `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow, which will build the package, attest its provenance, and publish it to PyPI and GHCR.
