# Reference

The Reference section contains the complete technical documentation for template-python — API classes and configuration options. This is the section to bookmark when you need to look something up.

## Python API Usage

`project_name` can also be used programmatically in your own Python scripts:

```python
from project_name import Settings, configure_logger, logger
from project_name.logging import LoggingSettings

# Initialize the global logger
configure_logger(LoggingSettings(enabled=True, level="INFO"))

# Load application settings
settings = Settings(environment="production")

# Log the current configuration
logger.info("Application initialized with settings: {}", settings)
```

## Generating Reference Docs

This project is pre-configured to work with [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) for auto-generating API documentation from docstrings.

### Setup

> [!NOTE]
> `mkdocstrings` supports multiple languages via handlers (e.g., Python, C++, Crystal). See the [mkdocstrings documentation](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) to configure it for your language.

1. The plugin and its Python handler are already managed by Hatch in the `docs` environment (`mkdocstrings[python]`).
1. Configure `mkdocs.yml` according to your language handler and create your reference pages.
